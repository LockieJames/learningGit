All git commands in lesson 3:
    git init -> creates a new repository in that folder
    git status -> shows files and changes that have not been committed
    git add 'file' -> adds file to staging area that you want to commit
    git reset -> this resets anything you added to the staging area
    git commit -m "commit message" -> this commits anything from the staging area into your repository
    git diff -> shows the changes between the working directory and the staging area
    git diff --staged -> shows the difference between the staging area and the commit
    git reset --hard -> resets everything in staging area and in the file itself
    git checkout 'branch name' -> you can change between branches using
    git branch -> shows current branches
    git branch 'new name of branch' -> creates a new branch
    git log --graph --oneline 'name of branches' -> a nice way to display the log
    git branch -d 'name of branch' -> delete a branch name (not the commits)
    git merge 'branch 1' 'branch 2' -> merge two branches together
    git merge 'branch 2' -> the first one is the one that you check in too
    git show 'commit ID' -> this shows the changes in the commit compared to its parent
